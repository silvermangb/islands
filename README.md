# islands

In a 2D array of 1's and 0's, consider 1's as land and 0's as water. Given 2 land cells are connected and part of the same island if they
are adjacent in the same row or column, but not both, count the number of islands. Also, "color" the map, that is, assign each island a number and assign that number to each cell of the island.

    A B C
    D E F
    H I J

Cell E is connected to cells B, F, I, and, D, but not cells A, C, H, and J.

Solutions:

1. Use recursion.

2. Simulate recursion with iteration.
